# Non-redistributable content for testing

This directory includes PDFs (and maybe some derived artifacts) that
don't have any particular license, are possibly very large, and thus
should never, ever appear in a source distribution.

Note that for obvious reasons, PDFs containing *sensitive* data
(e.g. personal information, trade secrets, classified national
security documents, etc) should not even appear here and should never
even be checked into the git repository.

The sort of things that can appear here include:

- Laws, by-laws and regulations
- Official, public government or company publications
- Research papers
